          Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Robin. I'm a senior UI engineer at Taulia in Austin, TX,
          where I work primarily with React.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My journey to front-end development started with coding embarassingly
          bad Geocities Backstreet Boys fanpages. In between the days of Comic
          Sans &#60;blink&#62; tags and now, I taught ESL to kindergarteners in
          Taiwan and China for 6 years.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I love traveling, and some of my crazier exploits include being an
          extra in a Bollywood film, running a half marathon in North Korea, and
          skydiving in Australia.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I have two adorable kitties who like to make appearances in my
          conference slides.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My current interests include i18n, a11y, and mastering all things
          React. I'm interested in learning more about creating serverless apps
          with Gatsby.
        </p>
