description: What is internationalization and why is it important, even if your clients are mostly English speakers? This presentation will cover common pitfalls and how to avoid them, such as date formatting, number formatting, translating, encoding for non-Latin characters, etc. We will also briefly discuss all the UX considerations that come to play when using a RTL (right-to-left) language. Finally, we’ll get React specific and talk about a library called react-i18next, which is an open source library you can use to help internationalize your project.
